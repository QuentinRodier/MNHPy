# When a regular package is imported, this __init__.py file is implicitly
# executed, and the objects it defines are bound to names
# in the packageâ€™s namespace. The __init__.py file can contain the same
# Python code that any other module can contain, and Python will add
# some additional attributes to the module when it is imported.
